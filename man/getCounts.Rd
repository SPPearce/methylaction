\title{Produce a GRanges with counts of overlapping reads for a set of ranges}
\usage{
getCounts(samp, reads, bsgenome = NULL, ranges = NULL, chrs = NULL,
  winsize = 50, ncore = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp}{Sample data.frame from readSampleInfo()}

\item{bsgenome}{}

\item{ranges}{}

\item{winsize}{Size of the non-overlapping windows.}

\item{fragsize}{Average fragment length from the sequencing experiment. Reads will be extended up to this size when computing coverage.}
}
\value{
A GenomicRanges object with values() containing a table of counts for each sample at each window.
}
\description{
Will return a GenomicRanges object for non-overlapping windows genome-wide for the genome given as a bsgenome object for the chromosomes given in chrs. The values() of the GRanges will contain a table of counts for each sample at each window.
