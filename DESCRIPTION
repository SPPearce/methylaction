Title: methylaction: Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) from MBD-isolated
    Genome Sequencing (MiGS/MBD-seq)
Description: Performs a two-stage testing approach on non-overlapping windows
    genome-wide to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The
    statistical DMRs called by differences in group means are merged with
    methylation frequencies derived from modeling implemented in the BayMeth
    functions of Repitools to aid in interpretation. Multi-group statistical
    testing is handled with an analysis of deviance (ANODEV) approach using the
    GLM functionality of DESeq.
